# 🔌 Ethernet RJ45 Cable Tester

## 📚 Project Overview 

This project involves designing and building an Ethernet RJ45 cable tester using a PIC microcontroller and the C programming language. The tester will help in verifying the integrity and functionality of Ethernet cables by checking for continuity and correct wiring.

## ✨ Features 

- Tests Ethernet RJ45 cables for continuity
- Identifies wiring faults such as open circuits, short circuits, and miswiring
- Uses a PIC microcontroller for control and processing
- User-friendly interface with LED indicators

## 💽 Software 

The software for the cable tester is written in C and is responsible for:

- Initializing the PIC microcontroller
- Scanning the RJ45 cable for continuity and wiring faults
- Controlling the LED indicators based on test results
